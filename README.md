gl-clock
========

This program simulates an actual analog clock. It consists of the basics of an analog clock:
	- A hand to display the current hour, minute, and second.
	- Twelve identifiers marking the twelve (hour) positions.

This is practice for developing with the OpenGL and GLUT graphics libraries.
